            <h2>About Fyodor Dostoevsky </h2>
            <p>Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-1881) was a Russian novelist whose works explore the depths of the human soul, morality, faith, and suffering. Born in Moscow to a military doctor, he experienced both strict discipline and personal loss early in life. Financial hardship and the death of his parents deeply affected him, yet he pursued literature with passion. In 1849, he was arrested for taking part in a discussion circle considered politically rebellious. He faced a mock execution and was then exiled to Siberia for four years of hard labor, followed by compulsory military service. These experiences profoundly shaped his understanding of pain, redemption, and the human conscience.
            </p>

            <p>After returning from exile, Dostoevsky began writing some of the most influential works in world literature. He struggled with epilepsy, debt, and the grief of losing loved ones, yet his resilience and faith remained strong. His masterpieces — <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, <em>The Idiot </em>,<em> Notes from Underground</em>, and <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> — are celebrated for their psychological depth, philosophical questions, and emotional honesty. Despite a life filled with suffering, Dostoevsky transformed his hardships into timeless stories, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire readers across the world.
